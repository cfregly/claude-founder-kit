# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- The harness rules grade against task complexity, so a one-shot agent is no
  longer docked for the long-horizon machinery it does not need. HA006 (memory)
  used to fire on every task, which pushed a stateless one-shot to add memory it
  would never read. It now fires only for a multi-step or long-running agent,
  where continuity across windows is what makes memory load-bearing. A
  well-formed one-shot scores 100 again instead of a misleading 92.

### Added
- A doc-score gate in `scripts/check_docs.py`: every marquee score the README
  prints next to a runnable command (`# NN/100`) is re-run and verified against
  the live output. The rule count was already gated, the example score was not,
  which is how the naive-harness number kept reading 39 after the two rules added
  in 0.1.10 moved it to 23. The same gate caught the realistic-server example
  drifting from 66 to 62 as the contract and security rules tightened over
  0.1.1 through 0.1.8. Both README numbers are corrected.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- `contract_doctor.skill`: lint a SKILL.md, because skills are a first-class
  surface. Seven rules (SK001-SK007): a description that triggers (present,
  tight, with a "use when" cue), progressive disclosure (a large body with no
  references loads the whole manual on every trigger), a workflow structure, and
  guardrails. The suite's own skills score 100. A description-less, unstructured
  skill scores a C. Wired into CI with a good and a bad example.
- Two harness rules: HA009 (prompt caching on the stable prefix, the cheapest
  context-engineering win) and HA010 (checkpointing so a long run resumes instead
  of restarting from zero). The harness manifest now grades ten dimensions.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- `contract_doctor.harness`: grade the agent harness, not just its tools. It
  scores a harness manifest against the dimensions the well-architected open
  harnesses converged on (DeepAgents, LangGraph, Claude Code, Cursor): subagent
  decomposition, a structured return contract so a subagent talks to its parent
  and parallel siblings, async sibling execution, context isolation and offload,
  conversation compaction (model-controlled and selective, since even a 1M window
  fills on a long agentic loop), memory (episodic, procedural, semantic), skills
  as first-class with progressive disclosure, and a gate on outward actions.
  Eight rules (HA001-HA008). A DeepAgents-style manifest scores 100. A naive
  monolith scores 39. Wired into CI with good and naive example manifests.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD015 detection is narrowed to genuine raw-query passthroughs. A bare `raw` or
  `eval` token in a name is not an escape hatch: `import_model_eval` (model
  evaluation) and `raw_bench_compare` (raw benchmark data) are curated tools.
  Found by dogfooding the rule on a real 51-tool MCP server, where it false-fired
  on three of them.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- CD015, a tool-discovery rule: a raw query/exec escape hatch (`run_sql`, a tool
  that forwards free-form SQL) sitting beside curated tools makes the agent
  prefer the passthrough and bypass the surface. This is the thin-surface
  failure, where a coarse MCP surface drove agents to raw SQL SELECTs
  instead of the curated tools. Discovery is part of the contract: if the agent can
  route around your tools, they go unused.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD006 mutation detection reads the verb's position, not just the leading
  token: a verb anywhere but the trailing object noun counts, so service-prefixed
  names ("slack_post_message", "stripe_charge_card") are mutations again while
  trailing verb-nouns ("list_charges", "github_get_post") stay reads.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD006 judges "mutating" by the name's tokens, not a raw substring. A read
  whose object noun contains a verb ("list_charges", "get_payments", "get_post")
  is no longer mislabelled a mutation. Found by linting the real Stripe MCP.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD012 catches auth-flavored tokens (`access_token`, `bearer_token`,
  `refresh_token`, `oauth_token`, `session_token`) passed as model-visible
  arguments. The broad `token` exclusion that avoids pagination false positives
  used to let a real bearer-token leak through unflagged. Pagination tokens
  (`next_token`, `page_token`, `cursor`) and secret handles stay exempt.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD003 no longer flags a short but informative parameter description (for
  example "Commit message"). It fires on an empty description or one that only
  echoes the parameter name. Found by linting the official GitHub MCP server,
  which the linter used to flunk on clear descriptions.
- CD006 requires an idempotency or retry-safety statement in any verb mood, so
  "Create a file" and "Creates a file" are judged the same. The old list let
  "deletes" suppress the rule but not "removes", and imperative mood always
  tripped it.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD012 no longer flags a secret handle or reference (`secret_ref`, `key_id`, or
  a description that says the raw key never reaches the model). That is the
  pattern CD012 recommends, so flagging it punished the fix. A raw secret as a
  model-visible argument still trips it.

### Changed
- Synced the deslop canon to 1.1.0 (extended dash set).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- CD014 (injection sink) now catches conjugated verbs (`Runs a SQL query`,
  `executes the command`), closing a security false negative where a tool that
  forwards raw SQL scored a clean B.
- CD008 (overlap) flags the same object under synonym verbs (`search_tickets`
  vs `find_tickets`) that raw token overlap missed, using a shared-object plus
  read-verb signal.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- 14 contract rules (CD001-CD014), including the OWASP/STRIDE security lens, and
  5 protocol rules (PR001-PR005).
- Claude judge loop with deterministic re-scoring.
- `scripts/check_docs.py` doc-correctness gate that keeps the README rule count
  in sync with the code, and a CI workflow that reproduces the 19-to-100 marquee.
