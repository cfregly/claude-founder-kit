"""Deterministic lint rules for MCP tool contracts.

Each rule inspects one tool definition (name, description, inputSchema) and
yields findings. A finding is a dict: {rule, severity, tool, param, message, fix}.
Severities: error (-15), warn (-8), info (-3). A tool starts at 100; the floor is 0.

The rules encode one production lesson: most agent failures are vague tool
semantics, not model failures. A tool description is an API contract: the
model is the caller, and it can't read your source.
